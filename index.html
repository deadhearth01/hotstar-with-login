            <h2>Sun</h2>
            <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, and it is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="mercury">
            <h2>Mercury</h2>
            <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbital period around the Sun is the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System, completing it in 88 days.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="venus">
            <h2>Venus</h2>
            <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, making it the hottest planet in our Solar System.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="earth">
            <h2>Earth</h2>
            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor and support life. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="mars">
            <h2>Mars</h2>
            <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is often referred to as the "Red Planet" because of its reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere.</p>

        <section id="jupiter">
            <h2>Jupiter</h2>
            <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="saturn">
            <h2>Saturn</h2>
            <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. It has a prominent ring system that consists of nine continuous main rings and three discontinuous arcs.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="uranus">
            <h2>Uranus</h2>
            <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus has a unique rotation axis that is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="neptune">
            <h2>Neptune</h2>
            <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet.</p>
